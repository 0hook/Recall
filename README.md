## Setup 🌐

### Prerequisites 📚

- Node.js (v18.0.0 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation 📂

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/7sck/Recall
   cd Recall
   ```

2. **Run the Install Script**

   This script will set up the configuration file, install all necessary dependencies, and build the TypeScript code.

   ```sh
   ./Install.bat
   ```

3. **Configure the Bot**

   Edit the `config.ini` file to add your bot's token and settings.

   ```ini
   [settings]
   prefix=your_prefix (!)
   token=your_bot_token
   operators=your_user_id
   ```

   For multiple operators, separate IDs with commas:
   
   ```ini
   operators=id1,id2,id3
   ```

4. **Start the Bot**

   Run the following command to start Recall.

   ```sh
   ./Recall.bat
   ```

## Project Structure 📁

The project has been refactored into TypeScript with a modular structure:

```

│   ├── commands.ts        # Command handlers
│   ├── index.ts           # Main entry point
│   └── types.ts           # TypeScript type definitions
├── dist/                  # Compiled JavaScript (generated)
├── config.ini             # Bot configuration
├── package.json           # Project dependencies
├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
├── Install.bat            # Installation script
└── Recall.bat             # Start script
```

## Development 🛠️
